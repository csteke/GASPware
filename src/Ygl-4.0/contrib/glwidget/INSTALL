INSTALLATION of libglwidget

If you have Imake (you should...):

	1. Type "xmkmf -a"

	2. Type "make install".
	   Type "make install.man".

	3. Look into the examples directory. Two example programs
	   should be there.

If not:

	Copy Makefile.std to Makefile and edit it for your system.
	Try "make".
	Try "make install" or install libglwidget.a in /usr/lib
	and copy glwidget.g to /usr/local/include/gl (or where
	your gl headers are). Try to compile the examples with Makefile.std.
