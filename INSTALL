HOW TO INSTALL 
(i) download the file GASPware.tar.gz corresponding with your computer and operating system

(ii) uncompress the archive:
gzip -d -c GASPware.tar.gz | tar xvf -
It will create a directory named GASPware with the following structure
			GASPware/
				|-- bin
				|-- doc
				|-- etc
				`-- src
					|-- StopP
					|-- Ygl-4.0
					|-- cmat

NOTE: Platform dependent executables have to be already in the bin/ directory. 
If you want only  to use them and not to recompile the programs on your machine, go directly to step (v)
(iii) enter in the GASPware directory
			cd GASPware

(iv) compile the programs as follows
		for Digital Unix (OSF/4) : 
				make digital
		for Solaris 2.x
				gmake sun      ( GNU make is needed )
		for Linux
				make linux    if you use gcc + pgf77 , or
				make intel    if you use Intel C and FORTRAN compilers
		for Mac OSX
				make intel    (you need Intel C and FORTRAN compilers)
If everything goes well, the new binaries will be placed in the bin/ directory.

(v) set the environment 
add the [...]/GASPware/bin/ directory to the PATH environment variable
define the GSDIR environment variable to point to the [...]/GASPware/etc/ directory
